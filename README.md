# Udacity's Udaciracer
 
Udacity Project for MasterSchool which demonstrates knowledge in calling API's and Asynchronous Javascript
---
## About Project
This is a Udacity partially built-out racing car game. Throughout the game logic, I used the asynchronous skills gained in the course to fill in the blanks in this game. This is a learning project not set for production.

## Game Mechanics
* Select a player and track to begin. 
* Accelerate your racer by clicking an acceleration button. 
* The leaderboard live-updates as players change position on the track. 
* The final view is a results page displaying the players' rankings.

The game has three main views:
* The form to create a race
* The race progress view (this includes the live-updating leaderboard and acceleration button)
* The race results view

## Skills/Knowledge Applied
* Run Server using Node (npm i & npm start)
* Make API calls using Fetch (GET & POST)
* Callbacks
* Promises
* Async Await

## Contributers
Udacity, Faith Jordan
